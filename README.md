# Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of the YouTube tutorial on wave sequences, which served as an invaluable resource in implementing the wave feature in this project. Additionally, inspiration for certain design elements was drawn from various sources on Pinterest. The insights gained from these platforms significantly contributed to the development and creative aspects of this project. A special thanks to the content creators and contributors on YouTube and Pinterest for their valuable contributions.
